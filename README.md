Want to start your [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x) development, but don't feel like dealing with all [the extra fluff](https://github.com/playframework/play-scala-seed.g8/tree/2.8.x/src/main/g8) that comes with [the official starter template](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/NewApplication) or other example applications? (They're great for learning and prototyping etc. but not so much for experts starting a production-grade product.)

# The minimal setup for a Play framework 2.8.0 project

* Install [Sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/index.html)
  * MacOS: `brew install sbt`
* Clone this repo
* In the root of this repo: `sbt`
* In the Sbt console that just opened: `run`
* See [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)
